# [Flight Emissions](https://patricklake2.github.io/flight-emissions-viewer)
We built this tool to demonstrate the impact flights have on the environment, since international flights aren't are not included in local or national carbon budgets (even though they account for roughly 95% of total aviation emissions). 

We've started with Leeds Bradford Airport, but anyone can add an airport.

## How to Contribute
See the [ODI Leeds Flight Data repo](https://github.com/odileeds/flight-data) for instructions on how to add an airport. 

## Website
The website is build using Vue. It's currently fairly basic, but you're welcome to make improvements and open a pull request.
